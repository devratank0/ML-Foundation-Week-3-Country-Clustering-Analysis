# 🌍 Country Clustering Analysis for NGO Aid Allocation

This repository contains my Week 3 Machine Learning Foundation assignment completed as part of the Celebal Technologies Internship Program.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to analyze and cluster countries based on socio-economic and health indicators. The objective is to identify groups of countries with similar characteristics and determine which countries should be prioritized for NGO aid and developmental support.

The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, K-Means clustering, DBSCAN clustering, PCA visualization, cluster profiling, and recommendation generation.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Explore the country-level socio-economic dataset
* Perform data cleaning and quality checks
* Analyze feature distributions and relationships
* Scale numerical features using StandardScaler
* Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
* Validate clustering quality using Silhouette Score Analysis
* Build a K-Means clustering model
* Compare results using DBSCAN clustering
* Visualize clusters using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Identify vulnerable countries requiring NGO intervention

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

* Python
* Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-Learn

## 📈 Results

### 🤖 K-Means Clustering

* Successfully segmented countries into meaningful socio-economic groups
* Optimal number of clusters identified using Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis

### 🔄 DBSCAN Clustering

* Applied as a comparative clustering approach
* Helped identify cluster structure and potential outliers

### 🧭 PCA Visualization

* Reduced high-dimensional data into two principal components
* Provided clear visualization of cluster separation

### 🌍 NGO Aid Allocation

* Identified the most vulnerable cluster based on child mortality, income, GDP per capita, and life expectancy
* Recommended priority countries for developmental assistance
